## Sorting Algorithms

### Selection Sort

Implement the selection sort algorithm
In each kth pass, we determine the k-smallest element and place it at the (k - 1)th index

Properties:
- comparison-based
- in-place
- stable
- for internal sorting only.

Time and Space Complexity:
- Worst and average-case time complexity: `O( N^2 )` comparisons, `O( N )` swaps
- Best case time complexity: `O( N^2 )` comparisons, `O( 1 )` swaps
- Space Complexity: `O( 1 )` always
